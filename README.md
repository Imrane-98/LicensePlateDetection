# LicensePlateOCR

**LicensePlateOCR** is a Python-based license plate recognition system that detects and extracts license plates from vehicle images using **OpenCV**, **EasyOCR**, and other powerful libraries. Designed for high accuracy and robust performance, this project leverages advanced image processing techniques to reliably isolate and read license plates.

## Features
- Detects and isolates vehicle license plates using OpenCV
- Applies noise reduction and edge detection for enhanced image processing
- Identifies rectangular plate regions through contour analysis
- Extracts text from license plates using EasyOCR
- Visualizes results with Matplotlib

## Tech Stack
- **Python** for core programming
- **OpenCV** for image processing and computer vision
- **EasyOCR** for optical character recognition
- **imutils** for simplified image manipulation
- **NumPy** for numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** for data visualization

## Getting Started
